# Bootstrap-Portfolio
UCLA Extension Bootcamp - Homework # 2.2
# Week 2 Assignment

### Overview
In this assignment, you'll create two different portfolios. The first will be an update of the one you made last week&mdash;you'll enhance this one with a mobile-responsive layout. For your second portfolio, youâ€™ll build a layout with the Bootstrap CSS framework.


### Remember

You will be fully capable of doing this homework by the end of Saturday's class.

### Before You Begin

* You've learned a ton of material these past two weeks: html/CSS, GitHub, Heroku and Bootstrap. If you feel like you're falling behind, there's no need to panic. You'll have 22 weeks to digest and master this material.

* We're diving into JavaScript next week, and html/CSS will start getting less focus. Still, you'll find that a basic knowledge of html/CSS will help you understand JavaScript, especially when we use it to manipulate web pages.


### Instructions

1. Create two new GitHub repositories and name them `Responsive-Portfolio` and `Bootstrap-Portfolio`.

2. Clone these repositories to your computer.

3. Copy the contents of `Basic-Portfolio` (your first homework solution) and paste the mentioned files into `Responsive-Portfolio`.
  * Note: Be sure not to include any dot files (e.g .git, .gitignore for example) from the `Basic-Portfolio` repo.
  * If you chose the `Skeleton` exercise for your first homework assignment, contact a TA, who will provide you with a template for your portfolio.


### Assignment Two Instructions (Bootstrap)

1. Inside your `Bootstrap-Portfolio` repo, create `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.

2. Use Bootstrap CSS to recreate the portfolio you built last week. Your Bootstrap solution should *not* make explicit use of media queries.

3. Deploy your new portfolio using the `gh_pages` branch of your repository.

### Submitting Your Work on [BootcampSpot.com](http://bootcampspot.com/)

1. Submit the GitHub links to your portfolio repositories on GitHub.

2. If you deployed to Heroku, submit the link to your Heroku site in the same input field.


### BONUS

* Incorporate CSS animations in your portfolio. [More info here](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp).
